##Multiplayer Chess Application

A multiplayer chess application meant to be used with peer-to-peer communication with graphics powered by javafx. to run use the following commands in the root directory:

```console
mvn clean
mvn javafx:run
```

At the moment, only peer-to-peer is usable, however, support for a centralized server to host matches on is planned for the future.
